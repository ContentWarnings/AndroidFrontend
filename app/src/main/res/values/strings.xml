    <string name="about_page_paragraph">MovieMentor is an application developed by Jeffrey DiVincent,
        Adam Fernandes, Jacob Franz, Nathanael Gaulke, Lauren Morris, and Garrett Spears as part of
        our Senior Design Project for Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.\n\nWe
        wanted to create a place where users could gain more detailed information on potential
        trauma and content sensitivities found in certain movies. The MPA rating system has a
        general guideline for ages and content found in movies, but has been subject to differing
        classification over the years making it merely a starting point. We have also used sites
        like Common Sense Media and Does the Dog Die, however we found that they focused on parental
        guidance and extremely traumatic events.\n\nWe wanted to have a more expansive platform that
        accommodated all sorts of potentially sensitive issues to serve a wider audience and include
        other groups of trauma that may be overlooked by the general population. Additionally, we
        designed the platform so that a user could hide content warnings they do not want to come
        in contact with at all, as well as reduce the chance of movie spoilers by having users opt
        to look closer at a content warning they might be on the fence about.\n\nWe hope that you
        find this application useful in your search for new movies to watch that are interesting and
        trauma-free to you.\n\n Enjoy browsing and have a good day!\nâ€” MovieMentor Team</string>

    <string name="privacy_policy_page_paragraph">Overall our goal is to reduce tracking and data storage
        on users to promote a safe environment for all users.\n\n\n<big><b>"Tracking and Data Storage"</b></big>\n
        For users who do not have an account:\n\nThere is minimal data tracking which primarily
        includes data collected by CloudFlare such as which pages are accessed, how many requests
        are made, how many unique users are visiting, and the country of origin of said users.\n\n
        For users with an account:\n\nData related to your account such as your email and login
        credentials, as well as content warnings you have submitted are securely stored. These are
        available for your viewing discretion in your profile and can be exported there.\n\nFor your
        safety, your content warnings are NOT stored on MovieMentor\'s servers, rather saved in your
        browser on your local machine.\n\nIn compliance with regulations such as those presented by
        the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA),
        all data is secured and monitored for potential data breaches. Additionally users are
        provided with the option to delete their account including all data stored, as well as
        export all of the data stored on an individual.\n\n\n<big><b>"Legal Compliance"</b></big>\nMovieMentor
        reserves the right to give any data to law enforcement given a proper warrant is issued.
        MovieMentor is based in the United States of America, as is CloudFlare, GitHub, and Amazon
        Web Services. As of 2023-03-11 MovieMentor has not shared any data with the authorities.</string>
